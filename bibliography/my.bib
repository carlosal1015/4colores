  abstract      = {A formal proof has not been found for the four color theorem since 1852 when Francis Guthrie first conjectured the four color theorem. Why? A bad idea, we think, directed people to a rough road. Using a similar method to that for the formal proof of the five color theorem, a formal proof is proposed in this paper of the four color theorem, namely, every planar graph is four-colorable. The formal proof proposed can also be regarded as an algorithm to color a planar graph using four colors so that no two adjacent vertices receive the same color.},

Based on ECT, a simple proof for four color theorem for planar graph is then proposed.},

This is an old-conjecture due to Tait in the squeal of efforts in settling the four-color conjecture at the end of the 19th century. We have also shown the applicability of our method to another well-known three edge-coloring conjecture on cubic graphs. Namely Tutte's conjecture that "every 2-connected cubic graph with no Petersen minor is 3-edge colorable". Hence the conclusion of this paper implies another non-computer proof of the four color theorem by using spiral-chains in different context.},

We have given a general method for constructing counter-examples to Kempe's proof of the four color theorem and then show that all counterexamples can be rule out by re-constructing special 2-colored two paths decomposition in the form of a double-spiral chain of the maximal planar graph. In the second part of the paper we have given an algorithmic proof of the four color theorem which is based only on the coloring faces (regions) of a cubic planar maps. Our algorithmic proof has been given in three steps. The first two steps are the maximal mono-chromatic and then maximal dichromatic coloring of the faces in such a way that the resulting uncolored (white) regions of the incomplete two-colored map induce no odd-cycles so that in the (final) third step four coloring of the map has been obtained almost trivially.},

The problems that have been considered in this context respectively, are vertex, edge, total and entire colorings of the planar graphs. The main tool in the coloring algorithm is the use of spiral chain which has been used in the non-computer proof of the four color theorem in 2004. A more precies explanation of the proof of the four color theorem by spiral chain coloring is also given in this paper. Then we continue to spiral-chain coloring solutions by giving the proof of other famous conjectures of Vizing's total coloring and planar graph conjectures of maximum vertex degree six. We have also given the proof of a conjecture of Kronk and Mitchem that any plane graph of maximum degree "Delta" is entirely ("Delta"+4)-colorable.The last part of the paper deals with the three colorability of planar graphs under the spiral chain coloring. We have given an efficient and short proof of the Groetzsch's Theorem that triangle-free planar graphs are 3-colorable.},

Fabrici and G\"oring proved that six colors are enough for any plane graph and conjectured that four colors suffice. This conjecture is a strengthening of the Four Color theorem. Wendland later decreased the upper bound from six to five. In this note, we disprove the conjecture by giving an infinite family of counterexamples. Thus we conclude that facial unique-maximum chromatic number of the sphere is five.},

  abstract      = {In 1976 Appel and Haken achieved a major break through by thoroughly establishing the Four Color Theorem (4CT). Their proof is based on studying a large number of cases for which a computer-assisted search for hours is required. In 1997 the 4CT was reproved with less need for computer verification by Robertson, Sanders, Seymour and Thomas. In 2000 Ashay Dharwadkar gave an algebraic proof to the 4CT involving Steiner Systems, Eilenberg Modules, Hall Matching and Riemann Surfaces. In this paper, we give a simple proof to the $4CT$. The proof is based on the Principle of Mathematical Induction, contraction, and possible colorings of a minimum degree vertex, its adjacent vertices, and adjacent vertices of these adjacent vertices.},
